            Generative AI is changing everything. With tools like GPT-4 and Claude, writing code has become faster than ever. 
            <br><br>
            But does this mean the end of programmers? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> It means the end of "boring" coding. We can now focus on architecture and logic while AI handles the syntax.

            Python is slow. Everyone knows that. So why is it the king of AI and Data Science?
            <br><br>
            The answer lies in <strong>C-Extensions</strong>. Libraries like NumPy and Pandas are actually written in C, which makes them incredibly fast. Python is just the "glue" that holds everything together.
            <br><br>
            If you are starting your journey in 2026, focus on mastering Python's ecosystem, not just the language syntax.

            With AI hackers on the rise, traditional passwords are dead. We are moving towards a "Zero Trust" architecture.
            <br><br>
            Biometrics, Passkeys, and AI-driven threat detection are the new norm. If you want to build a career here, start learning about Ethical Hacking using AI tools.
